### Image Classification using Hashing Techniques and Relevance Feedback 

## Task 1:
Implement a program which, given a folder of images, one of the three feature models, and a user specified value of k, computes k latent semantics (if not already computed and stored), and given a second folder of images, associates X labels to the images in the second folder using the classifier selected by the user: 
an SVM classifier, a decision-tree classifier, or a PPR based classifier,
in this latent space. Also compute and print false positive and miss rates. 

- Input: trainFolder, Feature model (Color Moments, Extended Local Binary Pattern, Histogram of Oriented Gradients), k (Number of desired latent semantics), testFolder, Classifier (Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Personalized Pagerank)
- Output: Each image of the testFolder is associated with a X label alongside the accuracy, false hits and misses.

## Task 2:
Implement a program which, given a folder of images, one of the three feature models, and a user specified value of k, computes k latent semantics (if not already computed and stored), and given a second folder of images, associates Y labels to the images in the second folder using the classifier selected by the user: 
an SVM classifier, a decision-tree classifier, or a PPR based classifier, in this latent space. Also compute and print false positive and miss rates.
- Input: trainFolder, Feature model (Color Moments, Extended Local Binary Pattern, Histogram of Oriented Gradients), k (Number of desired latent semantics), testFolder, Classifier (Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Personalized Pagerank)
- Output: Each image of the testFolder is associated with a Y label alongside the accuracy, false hits and misses.

## Task 3: 
Implement a program which, given a folder of images, one of the three feature models, and a user specified value of k, computes k latent semantics (if not already computed and stored), and given a second folder of images, associates Z labels to the images in the second folder using the classifier selected by the user: 
an SVM classifier, a decision-tree classifier, or a PPR based classifier, in this latent space. Also compute and print false positive and miss rates.
- Input: trainFolder, Feature model (Color Moments, Extended Local Binary Pattern, Histogram of Oriented Gradients), k (Number of desired latent semantics), testFolder, Classifier (Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Personalized Pagerank)
- Output: Each image of the testFolder is associated with a Z label alongside the accuracy, false hits and misses.


## Task 4: 
Implement a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) tool, which takes as input 
( a ) the number of layers, L, 
( b ) the number of hashes per layer, κ, and 
( c ) a set of vectors (generated by other tasks) as input and creates an in-memory index structure containing the given set of vectors.          
– Implement similar image search using this index structure: 
∗ given a folder of images and one of the three feature models, the images are stored in an LSH data structure (the program also outputs the size of the index structure in bytes), and 
∗ given image and t, the tool outputs the t most similar images; it also outputs · the numbers of buckets searched as well as the unique and overall number of images considered · false positive and miss rates.
a) 
- Input: L (Number of layers), k (Number of desired latent semantics), trainFolder, Feature Model (Color Moments, Extended Local Binary Pattern, Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
- Output: Creates an in-memory index structure containing the given set of vectors.

b)
- Input: trainFolder, Feature Model (Color Moments, Extended Local Binary Pattern, Histogram of Oriented Gradients), imageID, t (Number of most similar images)
- Output: Returns t most similar images, the numbers of buckets searched as well as the unique and overall number of images considered and false positive and miss rates.


## Task 5: 
Implement a VA-file index tool and associated nearest neighbor search operations. The data structures and relevant algorithms are described in the following two papers.
Given 
(a) a parameter b denoting the number of bits per dimensions used for compressing the vector data and 
(b) a set of vectors (generated by other tasks) as input, the program and creates an in-memory index structure containing the indexes of the given set of vectors. The program also outputs the size of the index structure in bytes. 
-- Implement similar image search using this index structure:
 ∗ given a folder of images and one of the three feature models, the images are stored in a VA-file data structure (the program also outputs the size of the index structure in bytes), and 
∗ given image and t, the tool outputs the t most similar images; it also outputs 
· the numbers of buckets searched as well as the unique and overall number of images considered 
· false positive and miss rates.

a)
- Input: b (number of bits per dimensions used for compressing the vector data) , trainFolder, Feature Model (Color Moments, Extended Local Binary Pattern, Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
- Output: Creates an in-memory index structure containing the given set of vectors.

b)
- Input: trainFolder, Feature Model (Color Moments, Extended Local Binary Pattern, Histogram of Oriented Gradients), imageID, t (Number of most similar images)
- Output: Returns t most similar images, the numbers of buckets searched as well as the unique and overall number of images considered and false positive and miss rates.



## Task 6: 
Decision-tree-based relevance feedback: 
Implement a decision tree based relevance feedback system to improve nearest neighbor matches, which enables the user to label some of the results returned by the search task as relevant or irrelevant and then returns a new set of ranked results, either by revising the query or by re-ordering the existing results.
- Input: a) Results from the search task which was implemented with LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing, VA files). b) Select from the search task results to label as relevant or irrelevant.
- Output: Returns the new set of ranked results of the search task results based on the Decision tree based relevance feedback system.

## Task 7: 
SVM-classifier-based relevance feedback: 
Implement an SVM based relevance feedback system to improve nearest neighbor matches, which enables the user to label some of the results returned by the search task as relevant or irrelevant and then returns a new set of ranked results, either by revising the query or by re-ordering the existing results
- Input: a) Results from the search task which was implemented with LSH (Locality Sensitive hashing ,VA files). b) Select from the search task results to label as relevant or irrelevant.
- Output: Returns the new set of ranked results of the search task results based on the SVM classifier based relevance feedback system.


## Task 8:  
Query and feedback interface: Implement a query interface, which allows the user to provide a query, relevant query parameters (including how many results to be returned). Query results are presented to the user in decreasing order of matching. 
The result interface should also allow the user to provide positive and/or negative feedback for the ranked results returned by the system.
 User feedback is then taken into account (either by revising the query or by re-ordering the results as appropriate) and a new set of ranked results are returned.
- Input: a) query image and query parameters(SVM,Decision Tree) from the user.
b)select the relevant and irrelevant results from the decreasing ordered matching results result.
c)Take the feedback (-ve or +ve) based on relevant and irrelevant inputs given.
- Output: This is used as the interface for task 4 and task 5.
